# Anatomy
yolo task to detect the players in football match 
Description
This Python script leverages OpenCV and YOLO (You Only Look Once) for player detection and tracking in football match videos. The program focuses on video analysis, transforming the detected data into visualized player movement on a football pitch.

Key Features:
Player Detection and Tracking:

Utilizes YOLO to detect player positions in each video frame.
Assigns unique IDs to players based on their proximity in consecutive frames to avoid duplication.
Football Pitch Alignment:

Allows the user to manually select reference points on the pitch in the initial frame.
Computes a transformation matrix to align video coordinates with a standard football pitch.
Data Visualization:

Generates a 2D football pitch displaying player movement trails as lines.
Creates heatmaps to highlight activity zones for individual players.
Video Processing:

Processes video frame by frame, applying Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to refine detections.
Displays the video with overlays showing detected players and their IDs.
Exportable Data:

Formats player positions and metadata for export or further analysis.
Required Files:
YOLO model files (yolov4.weights and yolov4.cfg).
A football match video for processing.
Usage:
Manually select four reference points on the pitch using the mouse.
View the analyzed video with player tracking displayed in real-time.
After processing, visualize player data, including movement trails and heatmaps.
Suggested Improvements:
Enhance player ID assignment to handle occlusions and abrupt stops.
Add support for detecting additional objects, such as the ball.
Implement automatic data saving in formats like JSON or CSV.

# Football Player Detection and Tracking using YOLO and OpenCV

This Python script utilizes OpenCV and YOLO (You Only Look Once) for detecting and tracking football players in match videos. It processes video frames, aligns them with a 2D football pitch, and visualizes player movements and heatmaps.

## Features

- **Player Detection and Tracking**:
  - Detects players in video frames using YOLO.
  - Assigns unique IDs to players based on proximity in consecutive frames.

- **Football Pitch Alignment**:
  - Allows manual selection of reference points on the pitch for coordinate alignment.
  - Computes a transformation matrix to map video coordinates to a standard 2D football pitch.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Generates movement trails on a 2D football pitch for individual players.
  - Creates heatmaps to highlight high-activity zones for each player.

- **Video Processing**:
  - Processes video frame-by-frame with Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) for optimized detections.
  - Displays video with overlays showing detected players and their IDs.

- **Exportable Data**:
  - Formats player tracking data for export or further analysis.

## Requirements

1. **YOLO Model Files**:
   - `yolov4.weights`
   - `yolov4.cfg`

2. **A Video File**:
   - A football match video to analyze.

3. **Python Dependencies**:
   - OpenCV
   - NumPy
   - Matplotlib
   - SciPy

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy matplotlib scipy
Usage
Clone the repository and ensure all required files are in place.
Run the script:
bash

python yolo.py
Manually select four reference points on the pitch:
Top-left corner of the visible pitch area.
Top-right corner of the visible pitch area.
Bottom-left corner of the visible pitch area.
Bottom-right corner of the visible pitch area.
Watch the processed video with player tracking displayed in real-time.
After video processing, visualize player data:
Movement trails on a 2D pitch.
Heatmaps of activity zones.
Suggested Improvements
Enhance player ID assignment to handle occlusions and abrupt stops.
Add detection for other objects, like the football.
Automate data saving in formats like JSON or CSV.
